          The producers for our show tonight are Mark Reed and Will Vodrow. I
          want to thank them so much for their support of this program. Welcome
          to Ludology, a podcast about the why of gaming, with Mike Fitzgerald
          and Jeff Engelstein. Ludology, episode 101. Inferiority cardplex. What
          was that? Inferiority cardplex. Oh, okay, like a complex. Oh, Mike,
          that's very good. No, it's going to do inferiority card decks, but I
          thought that that was even a little more too confusing. Welcome
          everybody to Ludology. This is Jeff Engelstein, and I am here with our
          new co-host, Mike Fitzgerald. Mike, thank you so much for pitching in
          and joining the team here on Ludology. This is very exciting. I
          enjoyed you and Ryan's work for so long and listen to so many of those
          episodes. It's funny, I spent all those years on radio, but I'm more
          nervous and excited about this than I ever was. Radio stations with
          supposedly millions of listeners because here it's what I'm most
          passionate about and we get to talk about it. And we have people who
          know a lot about what we're talking about listening. Yes, and we don't
          want to spend a lot of time going into Mike's background. For those of
          you that have not heard him before on the show, he was actually on
          back on episode 64. And we went through a little bit of your
          Ludological catalog at that point, but just suffice to say that I
          think you've got over 70 published games at this point, including the
          Mystery Rummy series in Wivern, and you've done work with some work
          with Wizards of the Coast on some of their games. You still do work on
          the Pokemon card game, and I think your latest two games are Diamonds
          and Baseball Highlights 2045. Five? Yes. I always... You better track.
          So, you're bringing a wealth of experience to the show and I'm very
          excited to have you here. Well, thank you. I'm certainly excited to be
          here. And you were nice enough to start off with a topic that I'm
          involved with all the time. And actually, we were talking about it.
          This is always a soft... I mean, what's the word? A soft spot for me.
          A sore point for me. You know, card games I've always felt over the
          years just haven't gotten the respect of the big board games and
          everything else. And I always wondered about that, and we're going to
          discuss a little bit about that tonight. If pure card games are
          perceived differently by people who play games and why. And I think
          that's sort of where your title came from, which is very good, I
          think. Maybe a little bit too obscure at first glance, but hopefully
          it'll grow on people. Yeah, so, yeah, you kind of broached this idea
          to me. And honestly, before you said it, I had not really thought
          about that. That, you know, mentally we kind of, you know, maybe
          categorize board games as real games or, you know, gamer games and the
          things we want to do. And card games tend to get relegated to the
          second-class citizen status. And, you know, but as I thought about it,
          I realized that, you know, in a way you are correct. And certainly for
          me, if I'm sitting down to play a game that's just, you know, based on
          a deck of cards and maybe a couple of other components, just mentally
          I'm in a different place than I am if somebody sets up a big board
          with lots of components and cubes and tokens and money and everything
          else that goes along with that. So, yeah, I thought it would be very
          interesting to explore that somewhat and try to see where that comes
          from and what games perhaps avoid that and, you know, just ways that
          that can be overcome for designers that want to make a serious card
          game and have a card game, you know, kind of considered in the same
          way that traditional board games are. Yes, I always felt at the
          beginning of my playing and designing that I was making games that
          most people considered quote unquote fillers. And I would always say
          to them, well, you know, this is my main course. I mean, these are the
          games, the games that I, my favorite games on my list and my most
          often played games are mostly all card games. And I just don't
          personally, I don't see the difference in immersion and levels of
          strategy and, you know, just all the fun stuff that I get out of a
          game, the Oh wow factors, the, you know, the great ride of a good
          game. I don't find that to be a big difference between board games and
          card games except that I like that it better in card games. So that
          you have a bias on the other side of things. I definitely do. I have a
          very, very strong bias the other way and I'm beginning to appreciate
          poor games more. And even some of the heavier quote unquote euros
          recently like a combo and I'm finding really, really interesting games
          which I never thought I would. But I have done a lot of missionary
          work and tried to convince gamers that in certain card games you're
          you are getting into deep water. And when I really want to impress
          somebody I bring up Edgar Allan Poe. You know, years ago I worked on
          the mystery Rummy series. The second case was the murder in the room
          or and I got a hold of the story. I remembered it a little bit. I was
          in a rang a tank. I sort of remembered that but I got a hold of the
          story and read it because I wanted to really see if if I could make it
          into the into a mystery Rummy version. And the introduction of Mers in
          the room more by around Poe has a section in it about games. And it
          was just it was amazing reading because now this is a long time ago
          but it makes basically the premise that there is more to games with
          hidden information and different things going on in player
          interaction. There's more skill or more of the mind of brain that's
          using those games then games like chess. And I think most people
          including myself certainly at the time would say chess is a deeper
          more complex game than let's say WIST, which at the time was the card
          game everybody was playing. And Edgar Allan Poe makes the case that
          you really have to take into consideration things outside of the rules
          of the game to perform well at WIST. You have to sort of look at the
          whole picture. You have to look at what you don't know. And you have
          to look at how people are reacting and what people are doing with
          their card play, trying to read them a little bit. And the upper level
          poker play that's certainly the case. Now in chess, because I played a
          lot of chess as a kid, I do think it is more than just calculation
          because the calculation is beyond most people, you know most people's
          power of calculation at the moment over the board of a chess game. So
          there is a lot to intuition, to feeling, to try to figure out your
          opponent. But I think it makes an interesting case and certainly for
          me, for where my bias comes from, for some reason I really get into
          the exercise. Like when I get an opening hand of a card game, I am so
          excited to see what is in this hand and good or bad, whatever I might
          perceive the hand to be, you know, how am I going to come through
          this? And I'm going to be doing this game to make this an interesting
          play and a competitive play and possibly win, no matter what kind of
          hand I get. And that's the one thing that I certainly never found in
          board games. Nowadays, they're doing a lot more board games with
          variability of setup and different things. It's almost like to me, I'm
          saying, okay now they're starting to get the idea of what the magic of
          card games is. Because when you talk about a good card game, the
          replayability is just so built in because every game starts with a
          different hand. And I never felt that that process was any less
          interesting or challenging than figuring out your next move in Kailus.
          I just never saw the distinction. But certainly, there are many gamers
          who do. They find one to be, oh, that's the meat and potatoes and the
          other to be, I'm just sort of sitting here and throwing cards on the
          table. Yeah. And after you brought this up, you turn me on to this
          little section of writing by Edgar Allan Poe. And so I went and read
          it. And I just wanted to read a couple of excerpts from that, which I
          thought were particularly interesting and amusing. He starts out by,
          as you said, really slamming chess. And he says, he says, I'm going to
          assert that the higher powers of the intellect are more usefully test
          by the unastentatious game of droughts, which is checkers, than by all
          the elaborate frivolity of chess in the latter where the pieces have
          different and bizarre motions with various and variable value. What is
          only complex is mistaken, a not unusual error, for what is profound,
          which I just enjoyed. And so then he goes on to talk about it in chess
          that it's all about attention. And that it's going to be because there
          are so many, all these different things that you have to keep in mind
          and the way the pieces move and all the interactions on the board and
          stuff that it's all about concentration and the person who's
          concentration waivers for a moment is going to be the one that loses.
          But then he goes on and he talks about WIST. And he talks about that
          he contrasts what you talked about calculation, which is just like
          figuring out the best moves to what he calls analysis, which is like
          playing the player, which is just where you kind of like stare at
          people and, you know, either look for tells and what they do, or just
          try to play by the manner in which they're playing perhaps what
          they're holding. And that the interpretation of the hidden information
          that's present in WIST, as the example he's talking just puts it so
          far above chess. So he says, the best chess player in Christendom may
          be little more than the best player of chess, but proficiency in WIST
          implies capacity for success in all these more important undertakings
          where mind struggles with mind. When I say proficiency, I mean that
          perfection in the game, which includes a comprehension of all the
          sources, WIST's legitimate advantage may be derived. So he feels
          looking at everything is just superior. I just find it so much more
          interesting. I mean, when you look at that hand to cards, and of
          course, this speaks to the type of player I am, I mean, I don't
          approach every game to win. So I certainly approach every game to the
          best I can. But many of my most enjoyable experiences are digging my
          way out of what appears to be a hopeless situation and then doing
          okay, you know, maybe not even winning but doing okay, or better than
          I thought of finding these paths that are interesting. And I remember
          in developing Jack the Ripper, the first Mr. Rummy game, I had this
          list of opening hand types, and we really categorized it in what kind
          of game I was doing. In what kind of a game you were going to try to
          play from it, whether you were going to try to escape or you were
          playing a half escape, a half solve it, hand, or you were going to try
          to go out quick, all these different kind of things, based on the
          original 10 cards in your hand. Now you'd have to be flexible to
          change that because with card games, there is so much information that
          you don't know until you draw the cards, but I've just been addicted
          to it. And it gives me the rush and the joy of games more than
          anything else. I mean, lately I'm really trying to open myself up. In
          fact, I'm designing a game now that has no cards at this point,
          although every week or so, either I suggest it or a playtest is
          suggesting, you know, this would be really better with a couple cards
          that we don't know about yet just to come in. I said, no, no, no. Yes.
          Well, I think that one of the things that's interesting about card
          games, and then maybe we can pivot and dive a little more deeply into
          our specific topic about the inferiority complex. But you know, you
          hit on a couple of things which we've talked about in previous
          episodes of Ludology or Game Tech. First is about the variability of
          the setup. And, you know, one of the topics I talked about on Game
          Tech, I talked about shuffling a deck of cards, and that if you
          randomize a deck of cards, that in all probability, in fact, it's
          almost a certainty that you are the only person in the history of the
          universe that has held a deck of cards that is in that particular
          order. That the number of different combinations that there are of 52
          cards in a deck versus the number of times people have shuffled the
          deck of cards is just so far outstrips it that, you know, every
          shuffle is going to be unique. And in certain games that matters more
          than others, in certain games, you know, because there's symmetries,
          pursuits and things like that, maybe it's not as big a deal, but you
          certainly have tremendously more variability by shuffling a deck of 52
          distinct cards than you do and just like, you know, setting up a
          chessboard or, you know, even setting up a, you know, a game of Puerto
          Rico or any of these other games. So I think that that's, you know,
          speaks to what you're talking about that you never know what you're
          going to see when you pick up your hand of cards. And the second thing
          is that you touched on is the difference between what we call what we
          characterize as input randomness and output randomness, and we defined
          as two different types of randomness in a game, and we defined output
          randomness as when you take an action that the outcome of that action
          is going to be random, and you decide you're going to attack somebody
          in risk. Once you make that decision that you're going to attack, you
          roll the dice and you see what's going to happen. You don't know for
          sure what's going to happen. Whereas input randomness is where you
          receive a random set of resources to work with. But once you've got
          that, then the actions that you take are pretty much known to you and
          when you, when you're going to do it. And then the other games,
          although you do have hidden information of what the other players
          have, they tend to be more on the input randomness side, which a lot
          of ways lends the lens. It's that you've got to hand a cards and yeah,
          it's random, but you, like you said, you have to figure out how are
          you going to play this. And if you're playing, you know, a hand of
          bridge, and you're the declare and you've got your cards and dummy
          you, you, you have to put together this plan. And you can see the
          golden path in your mind that you have to follow through through this,
          through this maze to get out on the other side. So we're talking about
          the inferiority of the card games is just that feeling that they're
          not quite up to other great games we play these days. And I think it's
          not really surprising if you think about the initial card games we
          were playing as the kid, like when we think about old maid and
          blackjack and war and slapjack and crazy aids. And what's that other
          one? Jeff Spit? Was that actually a game? Yes, that was a big game for
          my childhood. That's a speed game. You're trying to make files as fast
          as possible. Yeah, so there's no way you're going to mistake those
          games for the great modern board games that offer a lot more
          complexity. So I think since people play them as a kid, they move on
          to other games, they just put them in that category. Now there are
          certainly complex card games. I guess bridge is probably the top of
          the list. Would you say so, Jeff? Yeah, but I think even in terms of,
          except for the whole part of teaching people, the bidding process, I
          mean, the basic structure of how to play hearts or space or bridge in
          terms of a trick taking game is still relatively straightforward. I
          mean, if you compare what it takes to, especially if you're a kid, if
          you sit down to play game of hearts with your family and your parents
          teach you how to play hearts versus sitting down to play risk or
          monopoly, it really is a whole different type of thing in terms of
          complexity and the little rules type stuff that you need to learn.
          Well, being good at hearts might be more of a heuristics curve or a
          learning process than risk or monopoly. Might be, I don't know for
          sure, but certainly hearts has a fair amount of depth to it. Right.
          And I think the other thing is that people also, you know, sometimes
          are going to confuse length and complexity. Just like, oh, kind of
          complain about the fact that people are going to confuse length with
          complexity. I just like, oh, kind of complain that, you know, people
          confuse the fact that it's complicated, that means that it's deep and
          profound. I think if you're saying, okay, this game takes 15 minutes
          to play and this game takes two hours to play, you know, the two hour
          game must be a richer experience. Well, we all know that maybe the
          worst game experience, at least for me, is when you get one of those
          games that should have been 15 minutes, but you're in the second hour.
          Right. Yeah, the depth of the interesting part of a game, I found some
          games to be packed, especially, you know, modern game design. People
          are making games that are, for the time you're playing them, they're
          just packed. There's no downtime. There's interesting choices and it's
          still short, but it gives you that much deeper experience. And I think
          that's part of our times, you know, people don't have as much time to
          do the much longer games, but I find that to be interesting. And I do
          not. I mean, I've seen reviews even when people talk about games and
          they say, well, you know, this must be a filler. It's a little card
          game or something, 30 minutes. Yeah, it's okay as a filler, but some
          of them offer just as much longer games of their type. Yeah, just a
          very brief sidebar, a different digression here. When we first did
          Space Cadets Dice Dual, which takes, you know, it's usually like a 20
          minute experience. Once you know what you're doing, it takes about 20
          to 30 minutes, but it's a very intense 20 to 30 minutes. We don't want
          it to go any longer than that, but we originally put... Can't. Can't.
          I would drop dead. I mean, I would just... But we originally put 20
          minutes on the box. And when people... We didn't actually sell it, but
          we just started showing it around to people... We got a lot of
          pushback that's like, hey, you know, why am I going to want to pay 30,
          40 dollars for a game that's cost... You know, that plays for 20
          minutes. That's a 20 minute game in their mind is in a different
          category. Even though I felt it was a lot of gameplay and a lot of
          depth and a lot of replayability and everything else, it just wasn't
          perceived the same way by people. And I think that that feeds into
          that. And then we end up changing it to 30 minutes on the box and
          people are much happier with that. I guess so. So look at the game
          since then, though. Look at these real-time 10 minute games. Right.
          And the clock is ticking and you're doing the same kind of frantic
          stuff. Yeah. Well, Space Cadets Dice Dual is the perfect example of
          one of those games that... Downtime? What is that? There isn't any
          down time. Not even for a second. And you're always at the edge. It's
          just a unique, amazing game experience. So it's just, you know, it's
          an example of what can be done when you break out of some of these,
          you know, other stereotypes. Right. Now, so I think that just so that
          perception that... And I think card games are traditionally, and I'm
          not sure really kind of why that is. But I think historically games
          that are based on a deck of cards are shorter. At least shorter in
          terms of a term that again, you introduced me to of the atom of a
          game. Because, you know, certainly like hearts, you could play all
          night or poker. You could play for six hours straight. So they're not
          short games, but they've got this concept of a short... Most of them
          have a short atom. And so maybe you can explain that concept a little
          bit for the listeners. Sure. Yes. And I learned it from Richard
          Garfield in the Magic of the Gathering Days. But an atom is the
          smallest portion of a game that you can play and have a satisfying
          feeling that you completed something. So now there's... You certainly
          debate what the atom is in certain games. Some games don't have any
          atoms. I mean, I played Kambal any other day and I was even trying to
          think, is there an atom in here? Yeah, the three hours is an atom.
          Right. That's really that sort of completion feeling after doing
          something. Traditional card games offer some great examples. I mean,
          certainly, you know, any trick to a game one trick is an atom. Because
          you have a beginning middle of the man, you have a feeling and you're
          doing... Of course you're doing what you're going to do throughout the
          entire game. Capsule down into one little shot. Poker may be one of
          the best atoms because one hand of poker, although there's going to be
          betting in different things of all, a poker plays over many, many
          games. So hands. So that one hand, you know, can really be an
          interesting thing and changes its interest as these atoms are put
          together, they make up a different hole every time, which is kind of
          the fascination of having a good atom. It's not that a game has to
          have that. It's just that if it does, it's a strong... And it's used
          properly. It can be a strong part of the game. You know, my latest
          game, Baseball Highlights, is built on a... About a five-minute atom,
          which is a one game of baseball in the game that plays very quickly.
          And so I just tried to build off of that repeatedly and that game
          keeps changing as you add more players to your deck, et cetera, et
          cetera. But it gave this nice feeling, I think, of being able to play
          in many different formats and deciding how many of these games you
          want to play and how you're going to determine the winner. And it's
          just a very strong element of that game. Other games, you know, don't
          really have to have it, but when they do, I think it's very strong and
          certainly in card games, yes, trick-taking, all these things have very
          nice atoms in them. Do you feel that that makes them feel perhaps
          shorter and less substantial because the games come to these little
          coders, whether it's a trick? You know, like if you look at hearts,
          there's several different rhythms going on. You've got the trick.
          You've got the hand. You've got the series of hands until you reach
          the score or whatever your target is or you just play until people get
          bored and walk away. Do you feel that having those little, you know,
          different levels of rhythm, different speeds of rhythm makes the game
          feel simpler or perhaps feel less substantial? Well, that's
          interesting because it doesn't for me, but I think it does for other
          game players. And actually what you were talking about, we're going to
          get to it in a little bit, something called the Magic Circle, I think
          is something I have sort of just missed and isn't all that necessary
          for me to enjoy a game, but boy, the way you, you know, we're going to
          talk about that. I think your viewpoint of it really shows that yes,
          there is something missing when you do this. The secret for a game
          with atoms is that each atom be different in the sense that you have
          different things to consider in different things going on. If they
          were the same or they're too much the same, that's when, yeah, I don't
          want to do this anymore. It comes to bear. But I think it's yes, I do
          think you're right. I think probably when you realize that to get to a
          satisfying point is going to take a longer time, if the investment is
          worth it, I think that's where some of the payoffs come in the bigger,
          longer games. But I think card games almost without exception have
          these shorter atom spaces. And yeah, shorter. I mean, you know, I
          remember as far as length goes with Mr. Rummy, I just figured three
          hands. I've got to make each game most of the time and in three hands.
          And each hand shouldn't have to take more than 10 minutes once players
          know the game. So I was shooting for that 30-minute mark as well
          because I felt anything much longer than that. And it cannot stay as
          welcome for that session. Yeah, so I think it's yes. I think card
          games definitely shorter. And I think the atoms are part of that with
          the really short atoms. Yeah, another factor that I think perhaps
          contributes to card games being perceived as less serious is just
          something as simple as the price point. I mean, if you compare, you
          know, they tend to come in a smaller box, you're usually in the $10 to
          $20 price point as opposed to the $40 to $60 or $100 price point. And
          that's going to naturally skew people's perceptions into saying, oh,
          this isn't, you know, as serious a game. Although, you know, some of
          these can have a tremendous amount of game built into that tiny box.
          And it's interesting how the design and the publishing side of it too.
          Cards are not cheap to do. So, you know, certain games, you know,
          publishers like to see a formula where the car or whether or not they
          have any different cards and they can get them in a certain pack and a
          certain sheet run at the factory and boom, they're done. As a game
          designer, I find that I found out much too late the impact of these
          lower price points on the games because the percentage then that I was
          involved with is much smaller. However, if they do well, they can tend
          to sell more units. So, yeah, if you have a good one, I think it does.
          Yeah. So the total volume overall, the dollar volume of the sales is
          going to be higher than a really high price point game. Even though
          your individual price is much lower. Yeah, I think you're right. Now,
          what about this magic circle, Jeff? Because I had not really thought
          about this that much, but you, you maintain that these games, they
          don't create in cars. They don't usually create the kind of atmosphere
          that a board game could focus environment. I mean, this goes back to a
          concept that we discussed. I didn't write down this show number, but
          we had a show with Eric Zimmerman from the NYU Game Center about this
          concept of the magic circle, which originated in the early 1900s, but,
          you know, was popularized later in the 20th century. You know, the
          idea is that part of any game is that it creates a kind of a shared
          social space, a shared social contract. And part of that is just the
          rules. You all agree that you're not just going to reach over and you
          can't just pick up your piece and put it anywhere that you want. There
          are certain restraints and constraints on what you're allowed to do.
          And by everybody accepting that, accepting those rules, that's one way
          that you enter this idea of the magic circle. It's a space that's
          separate from the real world. But I think, you know, part of the
          engagement that comes to the magic circle, and there's thousands of
          exceptions, which I'm going to... I'll come back to. But I mean, part
          of the engagement is the thematic engagement of the magic circle. And,
          you know, there are certain games that will evoke a theme, an
          atmosphere, an experience for the players. And if all of the players
          buy into that, it can really be magical. You know, you can find
          yourself transported into a different environment and, you know,
          different relationships to the point where sometimes it carries over
          outside the world. If you get too heavily into a diplomacy game and
          friendships are ruined and lines scattered on the floor, because
          people, you know, get so invested in what's going on on the board.
          And, you know, just for me, I find that I do not get as engaged from a
          thematic standpoint from, you know, like, if I'm, you know, if I'm
          playing, you know, a battle star Galactica or... Yeah, even a dice
          duel or something. You know, I don't get that same feeling if I'm
          sitting there and I'm playing something that's more, you know, just
          more a traditional type of card game or a deck of cards. And I think
          that's the other, it's, you know, even like Seven Wonders, you know, I
          don't get that same engagement that I will get in something, you know,
          when I... I don't get that same level of engagement as I do when
          there's a board and there's pieces and there's stuff spread out all
          over the place and you've, you know, converted this entire tabletop
          surface into the world that you're playing over. Let me mention one of
          your favorite card games, because I wonder if it does give you a
          little more of that and that's up front. Well, yeah, I mean, there are
          certainly ways to do it and every rule has an exception and I think,
          you know, up front is a great way, you know, up front for those that
          aren't familiar with it is, is, was a game by Avalon Hill, an old
          warden game about infantry battles in World War II and the guys are
          represented by cards and their weapons or cards and the terrain is
          cards, everything is cards used in various clever and somewhat
          abstract ways to represent the relationship between the forces. And
          yeah, I mean, but in that case, you almost are like, creating a board
          game's surface by spreading things out. And I feel that some games do
          that better than others, like I feel like, you know, I feel that, say,
          a game like Thunderstone, which, you know, has its issues, but I feel
          that the way it's placed out on the table, that it still kind of gives
          you that feeling of a dungeon and here's the monsters and I'm going
          after it, whereas some other, you know, deck builders don't really
          give you that feel. Like Nightfall, I think the game is the we're all
          fun. I never really get a strong, solid sense of theme out of that,
          although the cards are thematic and the pictures on the cards are
          thematic, but you're not, I just don't engage in it in the same way.
          And, you know, I haven't other than that little mini game that you and
          I played, I haven't played baseball highlights, so I'm not sure if
          that would give me the same feeling of a sports team. But that's got a
          board, right? It's got a little baseball diamond board and you put
          these guys on it. Each player's got their own field and stuff. Yeah, I
          mean, it's an attempt to do that because, you know, I think you're
          right. You look at Arkham R, fully laid out with everything on it and
          you know you're immersing yourself into a world, you know. And some of
          these other games, it's just hard to reach that same point of
          immersion. I'm a big fan of a little game called Impulse by Carl
          Chatek, which uses, you know, he always likes to use cards in many
          different ways. So the cards are the board. They go face down to form
          these undiscovered space areas, you know, planets. And they're also
          the cards in your hand and they're also the actions on the impulse and
          they're also your gems you collect on different planets. And there are
          little ships going around. So for me, that game, you know, does
          immerse me a little bit into it just just with the fact that there is
          this physical board that you're moving around, even though it's all
          made up of cards. A game like Lost Cities, does that mean it was an
          attempt with the artwork on the cards that tie together and then
          having that just little board where you play your cards, but it's
          certainly abstract. It's not strong and theme, but I always found at
          least it was a pleasing environment. I thought with the card art and
          with the way it was laid out, but certainly not a heavily thematic
          game. Yeah, and maybe it's just my bias. I mean, I find, like, I like
          card games, I guess now that I'm thinking back on it, doing a little
          self-reflection here that I tend to like card games that have some
          sort of spatial aspect to them. I mean, I think up front does impulse
          has that relay at the cards to form a map. And, you know, I find that
          I kind of like that, whereas cards where it's just more in your hand,
          although I can find them engaging on a kind of an intellectual sort of
          a way. I don't get that same thematic kind of tie-in that I get with
          games that have that kind of spatial aspect. So when you play some
          pretty abstract card games that are come out of the traditional games,
          I'm talking about climbing games like... Yeah, teach you and stuff
          like that. And so some of these, and you don't... You have to approach
          it differently, I assume, because you're certainly not involved in any
          specific theme at that point. Right, and that for me is kind of a
          dividing line between what I see as a... You know, we talk about, you
          know, going back to the concept of the card game as kind of a
          second-class citizen. I think that's a little bit of it for me in my
          mind, is that when there's a board and there's a whole bunch of stuff
          on the table and happening that it creates a world that I don't always
          get in a card game. And I think that that's for me is like the
          difference between going back to Cheddark, I'm probably mispronouncing
          his name and I apologize to him. But, you know, is the difference for
          me, whereas we're impulse, I also enjoy, and I think is a terrific
          design, it has a lot of very cool features in it. And in some ways
          it's got similar features to a certain extent to innovation of this.
          But innovation doesn't have that same table presence, I feel, that
          impulse has. Oh, absolutely, yeah. And I think that that's an
          innovation also, although impulse is awfully chaotic as well. Well,
          yeah, that's why I happen to love this chaotic randomness, and card
          games do offer that more easily, I think, and as a design, then, you
          know, board games do in general. I just love the fact that, you know,
          when the game is going to be over, I mean, in a pulse. It'll be some
          again ended way before you think, or it can go on for quite a while.
          Now, even his other designs, Gloiet of Rome and that series, Econia,
          they, I don't think they have even quite as much of that magic circle
          presence as impulse, although certainly he has things going on on the
          table. There's different areas, and you've got your own little board,
          you're putting cards under, and I love Gloiet Rome for it's just, it's
          crazy play, and, you know, every card in the game is broken, you know,
          so, and that makes it okay. You know, if you're going to, if you're
          going to break it, break everything, because then you're on a somewhat
          level field. Yes. But anyway, that's, you know, that's certainly the
          area that I think is hard to do in a board game. You know, when you
          get into board games, especially the more serious ones, you're talking
          about planning out a strategy that's not that is stagnant, but the
          game is going to remain kind of where it is, and it's your job to sort
          of figure out the path you want to go, whether it's a game like Trejan
          or, or the older one like Puerto Rico, that kind of thing. Yeah, and I
          think that the other aspect of it, which comes into this feeling of
          seriousness, is because of that chaos coming also from not just the
          use of the cards and the fact that cards can cycle through the system
          so much faster, but also the hidden information factor. You know, just
          about every card game you've got, you know, you've got cards in your
          hands and you've got, you know, five, six, seven, eight pieces of
          information that aren't available to, you know, all the other players
          at the table, but are available to you. And in a lot of, you know,
          board games are more serious board games. There's, that's not as well,
          you know, that's not kind of the basis of it sometimes, you know, the
          stuff that's out on the board is usually a little bit more out there,
          and it's easier for you to make those kind of plans and it doesn't,
          it's not as radically different from turn to turn to turn as you often
          see in card games. Now, as a game designer, we always come, at least
          I, every, every designer get to this process where I'm at a point
          where there is too much information in the game to make realistic
          choices within a reasonable amount of time, because I tend to like to
          put a lot of stuff in there and then start peeling it back. So hidden
          information for a design process is, I find really important because
          it's sort of like, okay, how can I make this tree of thought for the
          player who's on turn, you know, be reasonable? I mean, they, you know,
          I want something that's kind of obvious, but I want a couple of other
          ideas that they might explore. So I want the early plays of the game
          to have this sort of obvious heuristic choice, and then later on, as
          they play more, you know, find out some other things, but I've always
          found when I, like, I just not capable, I guess, of doing what Stefan
          Feld does when there's like 10 to 12 choices that as a first time
          player, or even maybe a 10th time player for me, just speaking from my
          play, I still don't know, you know, where the real stuff is going on.
          I don't have a feeling like, okay, I'm going to try this this time
          because or where the weakness is so. So I, you know, I love hidden
          information. I love the, the, what, you know, a lot of people call the
          luck aspect of a lot of these games and that's many more episodes we
          can do. We can do our luck. And, and, but do you feel that having
          those, you know, 10 choices where it's, it's difficult to really make
          a decision in terms of which one makes the most sense right now is
          that the hallmark or, or is that make people feel that it is a more
          serious game? Because of that, as opposed to just having, you know, a
          hand of three or four cards and okay, I got to pick one of these and
          let's just see what happens. Well, now we're looking at the two
          extremes, right? So my guess is that it's, you know, that game with
          the open choices and so many of them really interests a lot of serious
          gamers because, you know, the number, I guess the number one thing I
          hear in what they wanted to gain just when I'm testing my own stuff is
          choices, you know, give me lots of choices and they seem to really
          like more choices than they can possibly do or more things they have
          to get done than they can possibly do. And so they're trying to
          navigate how can I, you know, do this and certainly that's an
          interesting exercise and, but I notice a lot of serious gamers really,
          really that to them is the juice that they're getting. Right. But at
          the same time, I think there can be too many choices. I think if you,
          you know, you can overwhelm people and if there's too many, then it
          just, it just leads to dramatically bogging down the game where people
          just just immediately toss out a whole bunch of the choices anyway.
          Yes, for me, it's wasted design space. I, you know, passed a certain
          point. I just won't do it when I'm designing because I guess I'm
          trying to make my games. There's a word I use accessible accessibility
          so that I'm thinking to myself, you know, as you try to channel the
          people play your game. And if you had now, if I'm making a game that's
          really for the crowd that's, you know, going to like the series stuff,
          I'm not sure I can do it. But if I was going to try it, then I
          certainly would put in even more of this choice of training stuff. But
          I'm usually going for a person who, you know, a solid gamer, I want
          the game to be interesting and fun for them. But I also want them to
          be able to play with other people that may not be as devoted to gaming
          and still have an interesting time. And so I try to get something easy
          to teach and I certainly try to make something with an obvious path.
          And this is just the way that I learned, you know, doing trade card
          games and other things, make an obvious path, but then make some other
          paths that can be as good and, you know, possibly better, but can be
          discovered by the, so that you will be so the flow player is happy,
          right, because he can just flow with the game. Yes, I can do that. And
          I'll be OK. I'll begin the game somewhere. And then you have the the
          owners and the other kind of players who want to really try out
          different things, whether it's, you know, do some crazy to watch what
          happens or find a different way. That might be more interesting. So,
          so I really get excited when I hit on that. Of course, it's easier
          said than done. And many times I'll do a game that in the end just
          doesn't have enough interesting choices or I'll do something and these
          don't usually make it a print. But designed by me, but I've done some
          games that are too complex and I'm not known for that and I don't know
          that I can do it. It's hard to find that balance. You know, I think
          it's part of the secret to to design. But you know, each designer has
          to make that choice. I think when you when you do something well like
          Stefan Feld, does he is going to, you know, he's going to go for those
          serious board gamers most of the time and yet he has made some games
          that I find just so good. Things like Notre Dame and Roma and early
          game he did, which is a card game, which I love. He makes some that
          really resonate through time. He's really brilliant. Others for me,
          there's just too much going on. But boy, look at the success of almost
          all of them. So he knows he has a steady audience for that level of
          complexity. And I would be surprised if he ever came out with
          something very light or a light card game. You know, the only one he
          did was Roma, which I think is very good. But since then, obviously
          he's done a lot more of the heavier games. Have you ever done a pure
          card game, Jeff? I have not. I mean, probably the closest was the
          first game that we did the Aries Project. The cards were, you know,
          fulfilled a variety of purposes, but ultimately you put tokens on the
          cards and rolled dice to, you know, to have the cards battle against
          each other. So I have not. You certainly have much, much more
          experience in that than I do. Well, for me, I mean, I was surprised
          how many runby games came out on this thing. I mean, after Jeff the
          Ripper, there was somewhat of a demand for it from the publisher. And
          since I was working full time in the radio business, it was something
          I at least knew the parameters of. So I would keep working on those.
          But in the back of my mind, I always had other designs developing or
          things I really wanted to do like a game about baseball, which I'd
          finally done. And I have some other projects. There's a game I want to
          do about Symphony music and composers and classical music in general,
          because that was a big part of my early life. And when I went to
          college, went to music school. So I've been working on that. That's
          going to be a hard sell. Fun with the design. Baseball was a hard
          sell. Yes. Game of thought. That's going to be even harder. Hey, I'm
          working on a game about subatomic physics. So there you go. Oh, I.
          Yes. That's a theme the public is clamoring for. So what was your
          first remembrance of card games? Jeez. That's a tough question. I
          probably, you know, with my grandmother, we used to play Rummy and
          Casino. She was really big on that one. That's a little game. Yes.
          Yeah. So we used to play. Yeah. I always enjoyed playing, you know,
          playing the card games with her. So I have really fond memories of
          that. My earliest memories was watching my mother who loved patience
          games. They were called the time, you know, Salater. And I would watch
          her play Klondike. And her favorite was something called Clock
          Salater, which I keep reminding myself I should look it up and lay it
          out again. But I remember there were others a pile in a circle.
          There's a big circle of cards and they're for each hour in the day,
          basically, or, you know, each hour on the clock. And it's sort of like
          Klondike, but you're moving cards from pile to pile. And there's a
          progression thing very hard to win. And if she did win, she got very
          excited. And then I play the basic stuff with other kids. I remember
          using baseball cards to flip against a wall. Did you ever do that?
          Yeah, we used to flip them. Yeah, absolutely. If you could knock the
          card off the wall, you'd get it or something. I'm thinking, because I
          know I lost a lot of my favorite cards playing. Yeah, well, that was
          always the danger with that. Yes, but I'm not sure that mechanic is
          worth bringing back. I've thought about it a couple of times. But I am
          not doing it. And of course, in modern game design, we have just so
          many card games now that use cards in multiple ways and interesting
          ways that I think, I've always felt this way. I don't know that you
          could ever exhaust the different ways to use cards in games. Well,
          we're certainly going to come back and talk about that. So we've got
          some future episodes playing where we're going to try to dissect cards
          a little bit more. But just to kind of wrap this up here, what do you
          feel? Do you feel that the issue is assuming that other people agree
          with our assessment that when you take out a card game that people
          treat it as not as serious? Is that an issue with the players? Is it
          purely the fault of the players and what they're bringing to it
          because of these factors that we've talked about? Or is there
          something that designers can do to give the games a more kind of a
          hefty feel that counteracts some of that? I think both are true. Just
          through this discussion, I'm refining my feelings a little bit because
          when you really look at a bias, like I have four card games and they
          analyze and look at it, no, there are reasons for it. So I think it's
          true that the deck of cards, most of the time, especially when we talk
          about that immersion into a bigger board game and stuff, they offer
          something different that I can understand why it's considered lighter.
          Now, certainly there are card games and will be card games. I think
          designers are addressing this now. They're trying to make... They're
          certainly adding cards to most all of the rest of their games as well.
          Notice that. So I think what cards can do for games? Designers are
          using them and all kinds of games. But the game is just cards. I
          prefer them for a lot of reasons, but I certainly understand what you
          were saying about the immersion, the board, even the length of the
          atom. I could see that there are players that want something more
          involved and something that's going to take a longer time and have
          more of a static universe that a board does. So I think I'm becoming
          more sympathetic and there are a couple of games that are board games
          that I probably enjoy as much as card games, but there are some card
          games that I just... I mean, a card game like Guildhall, I just think
          that game is amazing and it's the game that led me to my latest
          design, which is not using cards, but what the game does is introduce
          this game state design in a certain way, which you don't really... see
          as much because it violates certain principles of gamers game, about
          long-term planning, about the changes that can happen, the suddenness,
          somebody can just sort of have a much better situation and have a luck
          of the cards. But the thing I love about that game and the concept I'm
          working on now is everything in the game is going to be based on
          what's already in the game. So in Guildhall, when you play a card, you
          know what it does, but the extent as to how it does it is based on how
          many of that same cards you already have in your Guildhall. So this is
          the thing what you've already done is going to lead to more powerful
          things because of the state of the game, which I find... And
          Guildhall, I think, also nicely illustrates that concept of an atom
          because it's got that nice atom where it builds up to the point where
          you cash in your set and then you kind of reset back to a less
          powerful state after that. Yes, it's got an ebb and flow to it that I
          think is very interesting. So I look for unique and unusual games. I
          think card games have the advantage of being able to do things
          differently without the problems that a board game has in some ways. I
          look at it almost as something board games have to overcome. Most
          people look at something that the same things and say, well, card
          games can't do what these board games do because they're just cards.
          Well, I say, well, look at all things the card games can do, the board
          games can't. So it's just a matter of how you look at it, I think.
          Okay, so are we ready for the Episode 101 Lutological Lightning Round?
          I guess we are. This is such an interesting subject to enlightening
          round by far. My favorite part of the show always has been. So in
          honor of Ryan, I will make the honorary Ryan Sturm storm noises. Yes,
          you should go first. Now, who should go first or how does this work?
          Well, let's, you know, why don't you go ask the first question? And
          then we'll alternate. Okay, here we go. Question number one in the
          lightning round. And of course, most of these are going to deal with
          those wonderful little things, what, two and a half by three and a
          half inches cards. So the first question is your favorite game with a
          standard card deck. Okay, I have two down here. I'm cheating, but I
          still really enjoy playing poker. I, you know, that's the main game
          that I'll play if I go find myself in a casino. So I really enjoy
          that. And the other one we mentioned earlier briefly is Spit, which is
          this game that we used to play endlessly when I was a kid. That is
          just, it's a speed game. You're trying to make piles of cards. If
          somebody plays, you know, a three, then you, then anybody on top of
          that pile can put a two or a four on top of it. And you're basically
          trying to get rid of your cards as quickly as possible. So we have
          damaged many, many decks of cards in the process. And now, is that one
          where it's like the first person to reach the pile gets to put the
          card there? Not usually the first person to draw blood gets to put the
          card there. I remember playing. Yeah, just two piles out and you can
          put cards on either pile. Yes. So we can get a little vicious there.
          So what about you? Well, for me, I again have two. And I have two
          because one of course is Rummy. My cousin and I, when we were kids,
          played one million Rummy. I think some people play 500 Rummy. We
          played one million Rummy. It took us endless summers. I mean, we would
          just sit there in the summer. My sister would play with us other times
          she wouldn't. But we kept score and we would just play 500 Rummy,
          basically that idea. And of course that is in the same family as Jin,
          Jin Rummy. And these are games, both those games have a very, I found,
          very satisfying death to them. And again, the example of these games
          where, okay, you just try to go out early. You can hold. I always love
          the fact about the decisions around discarding in those games, which,
          you know, what, because that's like, okay, which card is safe as to
          discard? And do I hold the good stuff or discard? The other favorite
          of mine is Cribidge. And of course Cribidge has a board. So I don't
          know if it's, it, but I think that counts. It counts. Okay. That's a
          game my father taught me when I was very young. He played it in the
          Army. He was in France during World War II. Now that's a game I've
          never learned to play. I really need to try that. I think it's very
          good. But the one that you mentioned, poker, a lot of people feel it's
          a wonderful game. I don't mind playing it. It's okay. I just have
          never felt the need to get into it deep enough. I think that game has
          their medicine out that you still have to learn. Yeah. And that's
          really also exemplifies what Poe is talking about of, of using all the
          tools available to you that it's not just about the rules of the game,
          but it's about behavior and other things that, that flow outside the
          rules. Oh, big time in that game. Okay. Question number two, name a
          game that is really a card game, but most people would call it a board
          game. Well, there are these games that we call a card driven, right?
          There's a term, I guess it hasn't been around forever, but I'm not
          exactly sure always what that means, but I mean, I guess it means the
          main action of the game is driven by cards. I'm going to say one that
          is very debatable as far as a, as far as a game that's really a card
          game. And that is a ticket to ride. Certainly is a board and ticket to
          ride and the board has spatial significance. But when I'm playing that
          game, to me, I'm playing a card game. Okay. Yeah. And I, you know,
          certainly the cards are the heart of that and it's almost like a run
          game with something else, another layer built on top of it. So I think
          that's interesting and it does, but it does have that, that spatial
          aspect of the board. Where you're keeping score, but there's
          definitely action going on there. For me, for this one, I put down
          nations. Ooh, very good choice. Very, you know, there's boards to kind
          of hold stuff, but basically it's, you know, you're laying down cards
          to form your civilization and stacking them on top of each other.
          Yeah, that's true. I mean, some of these games, you almost don't need
          the board. You know, as long as you have some other way to stack the
          cards. Right. But that's a great example. And here's question number
          three, name a modern gamers game that does not use any cards. Okay. I
          thought of two, although, you know, they are not, they are pretty few
          and far between. So I went first with Eclipse, the space game, which
          maybe is cheating a little bit because there's a lot of tiles in that
          game for technology and stuff, which I guess you could argue or kind
          of a form of card. I will be arguing that. And the second one I went
          with was Puerto Rico. And I'll argue that on the same level. You're
          going to, so you're going to call me out on the same technicality. So
          yeah. Very, yeah, it's very, I mean, though the fact that those things
          in the game could have been cards, but they're not. Exactly. You know,
          the role, the roles in the Puerto Rico and, and the tiles, any clips.
          Oh, those are fine. That choice is actually what I was trying to think
          of. I was trying to think of a game with nothing in it that all that
          could even have been represented by a card. And so I came up with
          Jenga. Well, yeah. Okay. Well, you're filing up the wood and seeing if
          it falls down or not. Okay. I can't argue with Jenga. There's no cards
          in that. Uh, okay. Question number four. What is your favorite card
          from any game? Okay, no question about this for me and that is the cat
          at home in Gloiterone. And as we're talking earlier, every card in
          Gloiterone is broken, but this one is especially broken. When you
          complete the cat at home, games over immediately. Now, you don't win.
          There's another card that does that where if you completed, you win,
          but it's hard to complete. You know, this one is easy to complete. It
          really is simple to complete. And the score just happens normally at
          that moment. So if I have it in my hand, I'll be watching the crowd,
          you know, the people playing. And if they're not having the best of
          times, I'll just get it out there. That's it. That's it. Well, we're
          done. Okay. Well, I had to go with just an inside joke with my old
          gaming group, which is from Guillotine, the piss boy card. Just
          because that would be an endless source of discussion. Yes,
          absolutely. So I'm going to go with that. Okay. Next question, number
          five, what is your favorite card from a game you have designed? That's
          an interesting question. You know, most of the two biggies that I've
          designed, both have lots of cards in them. I have to go just because I
          love people's reaction in space cadets. When you take damage, you have
          to draw a card to see what the damage does. And sometimes there's
          nothing in sometimes it does something evil to you. And you know, a
          lot of them just mess with the systems of the game, like it takes
          extra energy or, you know, you lose, you don't do as much damage on
          your weapons and things like that. But there's one card that I threw
          in there almost initially as a joke, which is called a ray scrambled,
          which affects the tractor beams. And for those of you who are not
          familiar with space cadets, the tractor beam is basically a memory. So
          let's like concentration. There's 16 tiles and you turn over two at a
          time. If they match, that's good if they don't match, you turn them
          back over again. Right? So it's a memory game that you gradually can
          look at more and more of the tiles. And hopefully when you actually
          need to tractor beam something, you'll remember where everything was.
          Yes. Hopefully you will. So this card array scrambled and those 16
          tiles are on this little play mat for the tractor beam display. And
          all it says is you have to rotate that tractor beam display mat 180
          degrees. Oh no. And people turn up that card and they just like their
          faces just drop. And you know, I put it in there as a joke because I'm
          like, you know, I was like, well, people want to do it. They'll just
          get up and they'll walk to the other side of the table and then it
          won't be upside down anymore. It doesn't never says you can't do that.
          But people just freak out so much when this card comes out because
          it's such a subtle little thing, but it just totally messes people up
          and I love it. And when I'm demoing the game, I always make sure that
          I take because you randomly select the damage card. So I stack the
          deck. I always make sure that that one's in there. So that's so that
          the players experience that. So that's, that's one of the greatest
          things about card games though. You can put a card like that in the
          game and you're not disrupting the game. You're not changing so many
          rules that it's going to make it unplayable for others. It's just, and
          I do the same thing all the time. I put in cards when I'm making a
          game that I said in a Southwell, this is not going to make it to the
          final game. But I just want to see what happens. And very often the
          cards do. My favorite comes from my first card game after the training
          card games, the Jack the Ripper, Mr. Rummy won and it's called the
          Ripper Strikes. And simply I was really looking for theme in that game
          and I was looking for something that would help both basic strategies,
          which are trying to escape and trying to go out. You know, from Rummy.
          So the Ripper Strikes, you play it in the discard pile and you start
          turning over five cards. And if a victim comes up while the Ripper has
          truck, that victim goes right into play and you do what the victims
          do, which is let you draw extra cards, two cards. So it helps the
          person going out because they get more cards in their hand. They see
          more of the decks that they can go in and maybe later get stuff.
          There's a, there's a going into the discard pile mechanic. And it
          certainly helps the person trying to escape because more victims come
          into play and you have to get all five victims into play to escape. So
          it's what, it's the game, it's the card in that design that made me
          finally realize both of these games going on at once could work. And
          all the cards from that did both things. And it's something that I
          remember whenever I design things that it is possible with a card to
          help more than one strategy. So it's always been my favorite of the
          ones I came up with. Nice. Okay. So, question number six, name your
          three, name three of your favorite card games that do not use a
          standard deck of cards. Oh boy, there is a lot. Well number one for me
          is impulse and right behind it is guild hall. And then comes another
          trialgetic design, the glory to Rome. And I always include you crony
          in that, which is a, which is a simpler version. So these are three
          games that are nothing like standard deck card games at all. I think
          each one of them is quite unique in what they try to do and how they
          do it. And I'm addicted to them. And I just, I will never turn down a
          chance to play any of those three games. Cool. For me first, I had a
          very tight race. I didn't want to include both of them, but high
          society, which is cards, used cards to bid on other cards from
          Kynitzia and another Kynitzia game, Battleline are both really
          awesome, but I only wanted to include one Kynitzia on my list, so I
          went with high society. In terms of trick taking games, just another
          kind of category, I really like this game, which when I first played
          it was called De Sibin Siegel, which is the seven seals, which I'm
          thinking is definitely Dora, but maybe I'm wrong on that. Now it's out
          as Zing or some silly title. Oh really? Is that the thing? Zing, and
          it's just, it's a very clever, it's almost kind of like spades where
          you're bidding on how many tricks you're going to take, but you have
          to specifically say colors of tricks. There's four different or five
          different suit colors. And so there are these little chips. And so if
          you think you're going to take three red tricks and two blue tricks,
          you take three red chips and two blue chips. And when you take cards,
          when you take tricks that contain those colors, you turn them back in
          and you're stuck with at the end of the hand, it gives you bad points.
          But there's one player that can also play the saboteur who has
          slightly different rules, and nobody has to be, but when you're
          turning to big comes instead of bidding, you can take the saboteur and
          then you have to try to stick the players with as many points as you
          can. So that's a very, very clever trick taking game. I always really
          enjoyed my time with that. And third, I went for something which you
          talked about. What you talked about earlier is up front the war game
          from Avalon Hill, which uses cards in a really unique way. So several
          years, that was my favorite guard game and most played game actually.
          I loved up front. Cool. We should play sometime. I haven't played that
          game in years. Yes, yes. And the infamous question number seven, on
          the doodology, lightning round, probably the most important question.
          Each question more difficult than the last. That's right. What is your
          favorite snack while you're playing a card game? I am usually going
          with nuts, peanuts usually, and usually honey roasted peanuts. Yes,
          because you know, it's harder. It's hard to eat pizza. I find cards.
          Playing cards. That's very true. Very true. And it's interesting that
          we both pick something that has peanuts as part of the deal, but I
          like best are these peanut butter filled little pretzel nuggets or.
          Oh, yeah, those are good. Honey flavored nuggets, because they're
          easy. I pop them in my mouth. Now I do find I need something to wipe
          my hands off because the salt or whatever is on those can sort of
          build up on your cards. Of course, if you're asleep cards, it's a
          little bit better possibly. But you know, you got to have a little
          snack and I think both of us pick things that are easy to eat in the
          card game mode. So hopefully we've helped a lot of the listeners out
          to find the best snack for their card gameplay. Okay, so that brings
          us to the end of another episode of Lidology. Your first one kind of
          flying as a co host here. Yes. So I hope it. Very fast. And you're
          you're you're going to come back for one or two or we you got scared
          away by this. No, if you will have me, I will be back. Oh, we will
          definitely have you. So before we go, I would like to thank our
